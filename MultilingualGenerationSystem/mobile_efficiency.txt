This technical keynote explores the Mobile Efficiency Intelligence Convergence, a 2025 development paradigm that merges Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) with On-Device Generative AI. The source details how KMP has matured into a stable foundation for sharing business logic across platforms while maintaining native performance through advancements like Swift Export and the K2 compiler. By offloading complex tasks to Edge AI, developers can prioritize user privacy, low latency, and reduced cloud costs by utilizing the powerful neural processing units found in modern smartphone hardware. Ultimately, the text serves as a strategic roadmap for engineering leaders to build intelligent "Super Apps" by using unified codebases to orchestrate sophisticated, localized machine learning models.
